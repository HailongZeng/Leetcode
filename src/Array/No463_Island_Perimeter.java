/**
 * You are given a map in form of a two-dimensional integer grid where 1 represents land and 0 represents water.
 *
 * Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).
 *
 * The island doesn't have "lakes" (water inside that isn't connected to the water around the island). One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Input:
 * [[0,1,0,0],
 *  [1,1,1,0],
 *  [0,1,0,0],
 *  [1,1,0,0]]
 *
 * Output: 16
 *
 * Explanation: The perimeter is the 16 yellow stripes in the image below:
